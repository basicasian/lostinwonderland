## Game Description

*Lost in Wonderland* is an adventurous jump-and-run game created as part of the 2022SS Multimedia Exercise class of TU Vienna. The game follows a young boy who dreams of being an adventurer. After accidentally falling into an underground cave, he must find his way back to his family by navigating through a dangerous Wonderland filled with enemies and obstacles. The game includes two levels with different difficulties, providing players with a challenging yet engaging experience. Through virtual touchscreen buttons, players can control the characterâ€™s movements and help him reach the goal, avoiding dangers along the way. 

This project was developed using the **Android SDK** and adheres to the requirements outlined in the course, such as implementing a 2D arcade-style gameplay with persistent high scores, an intuitive GUI, and multi-language support. The game leverages the **Android Studio IDE** and runs on an **Android Virtual Device (AVD)**, specifically optimized for Nexus 5X settings.

## How to Play

To play this game, use the virtual buttons on the screen:

- **Left Arrow**: Move left
- **Right Arrow**: Move right
- **Upper Arrow**: Jump in the last moved direction (default: right)

### Game Rules

- You have **three lives**. A life is lost each time you fall off a platform or collide with an enemy.
- Complete the game by reaching and touching the **goal**.

## Technical Implementation

The game is developed using **Android Studio** with the **Android SDK**. It follows the course requirements, including using the **Room Persistence Library** for high scores, **multi-threading** for the game loop, and persistent storage for game data. The game leverages activities and intents for navigation, while animations and sprites are implemented to create an engaging visual experience.

### Game Flow:
1. Splash Screen

4. Select Level (easy or hard mode)
5. Game Play
6. After Game (replay, check high scores, or return to main menu)

## Code Architecture

- **GameLoop**: Implements game mechanics and rendering.
- **GameSound**: Encapsulates background music and other sounds.
- **GameGraphic**: Initializes graphics for characters, platforms, and background elements.

### Objects
- **DynamicObject**: Functions for moving objects (e.g., main character).
- **StaticObject**: Functions for static objects (e.g., virtual buttons, background).
- **SpriteObject**: Functions for sprite animations.

### Persistence
- **Score**: Entity for storing level completion times.
- **ScoreDao**: Data transfer object for score retrieval.
- **ScoreRoomDatabase**: Database storing high scores.

### Utilities
